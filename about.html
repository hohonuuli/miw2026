                <h3>The Marine Imaging Workshop</h3>
                <p>
                    Marine imaging is a significant advancement for science, policy and public understanding of the
                    world's oceans. The field is rapidly developing, driven by technological advancements. Imagery is a
                    non-destructive sampling tool, able to explore unknown habitats, and can inform the designation of
                    marine conservation areas, assess environmental baselines and monitoring of human impacts and
                    effectively communicate ocean narratives.
                </p>
                <p>The international Marine Imaging Workshops assemble multidisciplinary participants of scientists and
                    engineers to push the boundaries of marine imaging. Biologists, geologists, engineers, computer
                    scientists and end-users will discuss topics ranging from data acquisition through to image and
                    video analysis. Topics include imagery collection, processing, still/video annotation, machine
                    learning, image data management and much more.</p>

                <p>The MIW 2026 will be held in Gibraltar, at the <a href="https://www.sunborngibraltar.com">Sunborn
                        Hotel</a>. The Sunborn is the world’s first 5-star
                    floating yacht hotel, located in Ocean village, a hub with bars and restaurants. Close to the
                    Gibraltar/Spanish boarder, the venue is easily accessible.</p>
                <p>Gibraltar is a small UK overseas territory located at the mouth of the Mediterranean Sea, at the
                    southern tip of Spain. It is accessible with direct flights from the UK, or the closest airport in
                    Spain is Malaga (approx. 1.5 hrs). Please note, Gibraltar is no longer part of the EU, so visas
                    maybe required.</p>
                <p>The Sunborn will provide special rates for rooms for conference participants (per night):
